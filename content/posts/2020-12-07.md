Getting `alt-left` `alt-right` working between iTerm2, zsh, vim, tmux.

- iTerm2, setting the correct key bindings: Preferences -> Profile -> Keys ; Set preset to 'Natural Text Editing'
- zsh, setting and consuming the correct key bindings: Enable [zsh-vim-mode](https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode)
- vim, overwrite f mapping with w, since f is sent for alt-right: `.vimrc` add line `map f w`
